    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <h1>Programming</h1>
    <p>Programming languages are documentation that is implemented on a machine (computer) for the statement of
        algorithms and data structures. The term Programming Language is made up of two different words namely
        Programming and Language. These two words are defined as follows −

        Programming − When a specific program is to be determined, it is essential to design statements or instructions
        for the computer to carry out. The art of writing instructions for a computer to determine a particular task is
        called programming.

        Language − A language is defined as the set of all possible strings, words or sentences that can be derived from
        a given alphabet (a set of input symbols denoted by Σ. Mathematically, a language L is defined as −

        L⊆∑∗
        where ∑∗=Set of the possible strings derived from a given alphabet ∑. For example, consider a machine language
        where ∑={0,1}

        Therefore, ∑∗={∧,0,1,00,01,10,11,….}

        Clearly,

        L⊆∑∗.
        Programming Language − A programming language is a computer language that can be used by programmers
        (developers) to connect with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any particular language (C, C++,
        Java, and Python) to implement a definite task. A programming language can create desktop applications,
        websites, and mobile applications.

        History of Programming Language
        The first programming language anticipates the devices. From the first, the languages were codes. During nine
        months in 1842-1843, Ada Lovelace specified a detailed method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with Charles
        Babbage’s Analytical Engine.

        After some years, Herman Hollerith realized that it can encode the information on punch cards. It can pass to
        encode the 1890 census information on punch cards. The first computer codes were specific for the operations. In
        the first decade of the twentieth century, mathematical evaluations depended on decimal numbers.

        In the 1940s the first certainly modern, automated powered computers were generated. The definite speed and
        memory space forced the developer to create hand-tuned assembly language programs. In 1948, Konrad Zuse
        advertised a paper about its programming language Plankalkul.

        In the 1950s the first three modern programming languages, whose descendants are still in widespread use today
        were created.

        FORTRAN, the Formula Translator, was created by John W.Backusetal.

        LISP, the LIST Processor invented by John McCarthy etal.

        COBOL, the Common Business Oriented Language, established by the short-range Committee, densely affected by
        Grace Hopper.

        Some other programming languages, developed during the 1950s and 1960s include Regional Assembly Language,
        ALGOL58, APL, Simula, BASIC, and PL/I. The duration from the late 1960s to the late 1970s carries a major
        flowering of programming language. Some important languages developed during this course involve simula, small
        talk, Pascal, Forth, C, Prolog.ML, and SQL.

    <h2>About Pythong</h2><br>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level
        built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
        Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
        together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
        maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The
        Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for
        all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

        Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no
        compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad
        input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an
        exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level
        debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting
        breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
        testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to
        add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very
        effective.

    <h3><i>About Elone Musk</i></h3>
    <p>
        Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company.

        As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product design, engineering and global manufacturing of the
        company's electric vehicles, battery products and solar energy products.

        Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the world’s transition to
        sustainable energy. The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the Model S
        sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S received Consumer
        Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate Car of the Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the
        first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and sub-category in the National Highway Traffic
        Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, a mass-market electric vehicle with
        more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a
        million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, which will have better utility than
        a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV, which began
        customer deliveries in early 2020.
